# MayaTools
 maya tools I made for 3D modeling and animation
 
## GoldenRatio.py 
this tool is for creating new instances of an object in the golden ratio pattern



 
## FollowThroughFirst.py
this tool is used to copy animation of the first selected object and paste them unto the rest of the selected objects.

## CopyPastePoses.py
This tool will copy and past animations from one scene to another with the same skeleton names/structure.
Initially, it will store the scene skeletons in a json file and then use that json file to past the poses in another scene.
